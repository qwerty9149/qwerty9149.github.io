For a fuller look at how the story should be read, please consult Marina&#39;s Story Pack Buying Order Guide. In general, the main concept for this guide is that <em>the charts come first</em>: there&#39;s no point in buying a pack when all of the charts are either too easy or too difficult for you. Most of this list depends on when you can play most of the charts in a given pack comfortably.</p><p>One important note, however:</p><p><br></p><aside><strong><em>If you love a song, ignore all of this and buy that first&#33;</em></strong></aside><p><br></p><p>(Please note that in general, I will not be considering PST charts and PRS charts below 8 in this review. Generally, if the FTR 8s in the Arcaea pack are too hard, I would not recommend buying any new charts yet; see above for the exception.)</p><hr><h4 id="The-numbers-in-brackets-you&amp;#39;ll-see-later-on-indicate-what-difficulty-you-preferably-should-be-comfortable-with-playing-(i.e.-at-least-an-EX)-before-purchasing-a-pack.-You-can-skip-through-the-order-if-you-already-feel-comfortable-playing-a-certain-difficulty-unless-stated-otherwise.">The numbers in brackets you&#39;ll see later on indicate what difficulty you preferably should be comfortable with playing (i.e. at least an EX) before purchasing a pack. You can skip through the order if you already feel comfortable playing a certain difficulty unless stated otherwise. </h4><hr><h3 id="PART-I:-WORLD-EXTEND">PART I: WORLD EXTEND </h3><p><strong>To new players, the World Extend (WE) pack is probably the best pack to buy</strong>. The pack is planned to have a total of 20 songs, which averages out at 35 memories per song, one of the cheapest rates you can get charts at. The song and chart quality of the WE pack is on average very high, and the charts contain patterns not found in the Arcaea pack while not being too hard overall.  The 700 memory price tag and the hopes of free reruns in the future may put some people off, but given the uncertainty of whether there will be further map reruns for WE songs, this is the pack I&#39;ll recommend for players window shopping for their first pack.</p><hr><h3 id="PART-II:-STORY-PACKS">PART II: STORY PACKS</h3><p>After World Extend, the Story Packs are the packs I would recommend new players to buy first. My recommendation for main story pack purchasing order is this:</p><p><br></p><blockquote><strong>Luminous Sky (8) -&gt; Adverse Prelude/Eternal Core (9) -&gt; Vicious Labyrinth/Black Fate (9+/10)</strong></blockquote><p><br></p><ul><li>Luminous Sky is one of the gentlest packs to start with and has an extremely high chart quality overall. Halcyon/Ether Strike PRS and Maze No.9 are all brilliant 8s both in terms of chart and music to start with, and Fracture Ray PRS serves as a very good transition to &quot;graduate&quot; out of PRS charts and is a challenging 9 in its own right. The Message and Sulfur are easy 9+s, a difficulty which is at the high end of the difficulty range free charts provide you. </li><li>Adverse Prelude&#39;s 8s are slightly more challenging, and there&#39;s a rather large gap in difficulty from 8 to 9+: this is probably best exemplified by the fact that Vindication&#39;s beginning and end play like an 8 and a 9+ respectively. If 8s are too easy for you yet 9+s are beyond what you can do, this pack might be a good first choice.</li><li>Eternal Core also has this problem with a large difficulty gap from the mid-9 of Essence of Twilight to the low 10s of Sheriruth and PRAGMATISM, as well as having <em>problematic</em> 8s such as memoryfactory.lzh and cry of viyella. The quality of some of the music in this pack is relatively subpar for modern standards.</li><li>Vicious Labyrinth has good 9s in the form of Grievous Lady PRS and Iconoclast, but the jump to challenging 9+/10s is simply too large and unfriendly - see the reputation Soundwitch and Conflict have in this server. I&#39;d recommend getting this pack when you&#39;re okay with 9+ charts.</li><li>Black Fate should be purchased last (apart from story reasons) due to song unlocking requirements, and the jump from mid-high 9+ Antagonism and Lost Desire to the top-tier 10+s of Dantalion, #1f1e33 and Tempestissimo FTR is even more unfriendly. <strong>It is very strongly suggested that you should at least have all main story packs except for VL before purchasing Black Fate.</strong></li></ul><hr><h3 id="PART-III:-SIDE-STORY-PACKS">PART III: SIDE STORY PACKS</h3><p>The recommended buying order for the story packs go like this (ignoring recommended story order):</p><p><br></p><blockquote><strong>Ambivalent Vision (7-8) -&gt; Binary Enfold* (8) -&gt; Ephemeral Page/Crimson Solace/Pale Tapestry (low to high 9) -&gt; Absolute Reason/The Journey Onwards/Light of Salvation (9+)</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>No specific order: Sunset Radiance, Esoteric Order (see below)</strong></blockquote><p><strong><em>*preferably before 10ptt</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>You aren&#39;t required to buy all (or any&#33;) of the main story packs before buying these.</strong></p><ul><li>Ambivalent Vision has a huge gap between mid-8 Moonheart and mid-9+ Lethaeus; best time to buy AV is when 7s and 8s feel challenging. Chart-wise, Romance Wars, Blossoms and Genesis FTR are very easy charts; for the full experience, it&#39;s better to get this pack when PMing 7s is still a real challenge.</li><li>Binary Enfold has two good mid-8s; there&#39;s also a 10ptt restriction to unlock Luna with Singularity PRS, after which you have to grind the FTR chart to do so. This pack would probably be in the high 9 category otherwise. If you don&#39;t care for Luna, this pack can hold off for a bit.</li><li>Ephemeral Page has a high 8 and three low 9s, all of which are very fun; if that seems like a range you&#39;re comfortable with, buy this pack for maximum benefit.</li><li>Crimson Solace&#39;s Flashback and Flyburg and Endroll also sit in the high 8/low 9 range, though Party Vinyl is slightly more tricky to do.</li><li>Pale Tapestry&#39;s 9 is rather high in difficulty; best purchased when you can deal with harder 9s.</li><li>Absolute Reason is best bought when you can deal with hard 9+ charts; the jump from Cyaegha PRS and Antithese to the 9+s is very large.</li><li>The Journey Onwards and Light of Salvation are both best bought when 9+s are doable, with the songs in LoS being harder overall.</li></ul><p><strong>As for the packs not in order:</strong></p><ul><li>Sunset Radiance&#39;s AIUEOON and AWMoL sit in the high 9 range, and this pack is better when you can play these songs. If this pack&#39;s songs are appealing enough to you, you can buy it for the 8s as well. </li><li>Esoteric Order has a significant gap between Aegleseeker PRS/Crystal Gravity and Loschen/Far Away Light; again, this pack is better when you can play in the low 10 range, but if this pack&#39;s songs are appealing enough to you, you can buy it for the 8/9s.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="PART-IV:-COLLABORATION-PACKS">PART IV: COLLABORATION PACKS</h3><p>Recommended order:</p><p><br></p><blockquote> <strong>Dynamix (low 9) -&gt; WACCA/Lanota (high 9) -&gt; Tone Sphere (low 9+) -&gt; Groove Coaster (high 9+) -&gt; ONGEKI/maimai (low 10) -&gt; CHUNITHM (both parts) (10+</strong>)</blockquote><p><br></p><ul><li>Dynamix is the easiest pack overall, but Evoltex is hard enough that I don&#39;t recommend buying it until you&#39;re okay with 9s.</li><li>WACCA&#39;s Quon is an easy 8 but the 9s and the 9+ are all technical and accuracy focused; this pack should preferably be bought when the absolute majority of 9s are doable.</li><li>Lanota&#39;s Quon is easier than the rated 9+; it&#39;s a very good entry point for getting into 9+s in general. The pack itself has a good difficulty spread; if you like the songs enough, any time is a good time to buy this pack.</li><li>Tone Sphere&#39;s STAGER and Linear Accelerator are both tough and gimmicky, so although in theory this pack is rated similarly to Lanota I don&#39;t recommend this pack until you&#39;re able to do some 9+s.</li><li>Groove Coaster&#39;s OMAKENO, DX, and GHoR are all similarly tough for their rated difficulties, so this pack gets rated a bit higher than Tone Sphere.</li><li>ONGEKI and maimai both have very good charts at the low 10 range; if you&#39;re getting familiar with 10s, these two packs can serve as a second step.</li><li>CHUNITHM is all high 10 or above. There is no point in getting this pack or the append until you&#39;re doing fine on 10+s. </li></ul><hr><h3 id="PART-V:-MEMORY-ARCHIVE">PART V: MEMORY ARCHIVE</h3><p><strong>Buy these in whatever order fits your remaining memory balance, your skill level and your taste in music</strong>. If you&#39;ve got some memories to spare after buying an append, for example, you can always grab a couple of Memory Archive songs. If there&#39;s an event that requires a certain song, then by all means go for that. However, <em>caveat emptor</em>: <strong>here&#39;s a list of songs that are hard for their rated difficulty</strong> that you should read before buying.</p><ul><li><strong>dropdead: Can only be described as a meme chart, buy at your own risk</strong></li><li><strong>Fallensquare, Altale: Very slow; if your normal note speed is above ~4 then these may feel uncomfortably slow even at 6.5</strong></li><li><strong>Galaxy Friends: Extremely hard 9+, may feel like a hard 10</strong></li></ul><p>These songs may feel harder than their rated difficulty to some players:</p><ul><li>carmine:scythe: Unusual rhythm</li><li>Filament: Lots and lots of arcs</li><li>Einherjar Joker: Requires very high stamina</li><li>Scarlet Cage: Hand placements may feel awkward to some</li><li>Heavenly Caress: Crosshands, long 241bpm 16ths ending trill</li><li>AttraqtiA: Very difficult rhythm</li><li>GIMME DA BLOOD: Crosshands, slow speed, both at the same time</li><li>IZANA: Extremely difficult chart reading and hand placement (can be purchased as a mid-8 for the PRS)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Some final notes:</strong></p><p>1. I recommend buying charts (even if they&#39;re out of your difficulty range) if an event giving a partner requiring a certain Memory Archive song shows up. You can always play the Present chart and save the Future chart for later.</p><p>2. <strong>I advise in the strongest possible terms against rushing to get to 11 ptt for the sole purpose of unlocking Saikyo and Aegleseeker.</strong> Both of these are VERY HARD CHARTS, and you will kill your muscle memory dead if you rush it. To a lesser extent, this also applies to the other 11s: many a player has killed their muscle memory on Axium Crisis (one of the most muscle memory-dependent charts in the whole game) to unlock Grievous Lady and has come to regret it.</p></article>
