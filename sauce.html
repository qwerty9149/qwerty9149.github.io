Spacebar always starts a new tag. If you want to search for a term that contains more than two words [e.g. Misaka Mikoto], use lowercase letters and an underscore instead of a space [e.g. misaka_mikoto]. Some characters might have a longer tag with the series name behind it [e.g. shimakaze_(kantai_collection)] due to other characters sharing the same name.</p><p>2. A minus in front of a tag removes all of that tag from the search results; if you don&#39;t want yuri in your Mikoto art results, search &quot;misaka_mikoto -yuri&quot;.</p><p>3. Some special tags that may be of particular interest to you: </p><p>&quot;order:score&quot; orders the results from the artwork with the highest to the one with the lowest score.</p><p>&quot;rating:s&quot; returns safe for work artwork. (You can use <a href="http://safebooru.donmai.us/" target="_blank">Safebooru</a> if you only want safe art.) Naturally, &quot;-rating:s&quot; returns NSFW art.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 id="HENTAI-MANGA-AND-TRANSLATIONS">HENTAI MANGA AND TRANSLATIONS</h3><p><br></p><p><a href="https://e-hentai.org/" target="_blank">https://e-hentai.org/</a> </p><p>The big daddy of all hentai artwork sites. Has a bland interface but is also the most complete and has no ads; also hosts things like R18 cosplay and non-hentai manga, as well as some artwork that would otherwise be paid content only. Filters some tags, the &quot;hidden&quot; website <a href="https://exhentai.org/" target="_blank">https://exhentai.org/</a> (aka sadpanda) does not. You need to log in to the forums (and possibly wait a week) to access sadpanda. An archive of deleted uploads can be found at <a href="https://panda.chaika.moe/" target="_blank">panda.chaika.moe</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://nhentai.net/" target="_blank">https://nhentai.net</a>/</p><p>The plebian version of e-hentai. Main features are image preloading and (generally) faster speeds. Annoying ads, bring your own adblocker. The &quot;default&quot; website everyone uses when they mention hentai; the 6 (or sometimes 5) digit numbers you see on /r/animemes and other places refer to the manga IDs on this website.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 id="ANIMATED-HENTAI-AND-OTHERS">ANIMATED HENTAI AND OTHERS</h3><p><br></p><p><a href="https://sukebei.nyaa.si/" target="_blank">https://sukebei.nyaa.si/</a></p><p>This is <em>the</em> one-stop shop for downloading hentai anime via torrents, as streaming websites tend to be unreliable and may interrupt a session with buffering.
