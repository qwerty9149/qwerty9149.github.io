In chapter 83, we&#39;re told that Miyuki and Kei&#39;s mother (hereafter Mamagane) has been avoiding their father (Papagane) for seven years, and is probably playing around with younger men. In chapter 208, Papagane explains to Kaguya that Mamagane left him due to his mismanagement of the company, leading her to become disillusioned and eventually bring Kei along with her to places unknown, although she ran away and came back to Papagane later.

In chapter 208, Papagane explains to Kaguya that Mamagane left him due to his mismanagement of the company, leading her to become disillusioned and eventually bring Kei along with her to places unknown, although she ran away and came back to Papagane later.</p><p>Our biggest clue to where the fuck Mamagane went is this conversation that happens after Papagane&#39;s exposition:</p><figure><img src="https://qwerty9149.s-ul.eu/IVG9G4hI"><figcaption>Fig. 2.1  Fanservice (208 p.11)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://qwerty9149.s-ul.eu/ySWop5Ao"><figcaption>Fig. 2.2 A suspicious reply (p.12)</figcaption></figure><p>Basically, it&#39;s all but stated here by Kei that somehow Kaguya of all people was the one who told Kei to leave Mamagane and return to her dad and brother. Given how young we see Miyuki is when she left (see Fig. 1), the corresponding Kaguya who told Kei to run away can be assumed to be pre-defrosting or even as small as in the flashback with Maki.</p><figure><img src="https://qwerty9149.s-ul.eu/eohwTwZk"><figcaption>Fig. 3  Smolguya and Smolmaki (168 p.3)</figcaption></figure><p>Given what we know of Kaguya during this period, and how nicely Kei puts what Kaguya said to her, it seems unlikely that Kaguya would have &quot;played nice&quot; to other people around her age outside of the context of things such as the high class dinner parties in Fig. 3 (for examples, see Kaguya&#39;s monologue in Chapter 146 and her one-off to Chika in Chapter 222, the second of which demonstrates another example of Kaguya forgetting one-off things she said to others before). In any case, as Kei was brought along with Mamagane, Kei being able to access Kaguya in a state of &quot;being nice&quot; is almost certainly a direct consequence of Mamagane (still?) being able to do so after she left; this means there&#39;s still some connection between her and the Shinomiya and/or the Shijo families that allows her be considered part of the family (or at least be welcome enough to attend events) which would allow Kaguya to tell Kei to run. Of course, there&#39;s also the possibility that Kaguya simply told her somewhere else (for example at school), but in this case, it&#39;s a lot more possible that Kaguya would have done so a lot more harshly and not as gently as Kei puts it. In any case, it&#39;s not a long stretch to say that this connection is also what&#39;s been keeping her alive and fed for the last seven years, though we don&#39;t know the details of where exactly Mamagane fits into the picture.</p><p>***</p><p>Possibly unrelated side note 1: We know of Mikado and Maki&#39;s father (see Fig. 3), but we haven&#39;t seen their mother yet. One hypothesis is that the mysterious woman that shows up in chapter 226 is Mamagane, who acts as a stepmother/aunt figure to the twins. The general hair length and colour seem to match up with her.</p><figure><img src="https://qwerty9149.s-ul.eu/zOHGjc8A"><figcaption>Fig. 4  Her hair length shows that she isn&#39;t Maki (216 p.1)</figcaption></figure><p>Possibly unrelated side note 2: Kaguya has consistently said that the only person who has been nice to her in her family is her sister-in-law, who is never physically shown in-series. She also has a very young nephew (although the father of said nephew is never specified).</p><p>Conveniently, Kaguya has a brother (the second eldest) who hasn&#39;t appeared in the series yet, and is described in the volume 21 extras as &quot;cowardly&quot;, though Kaguya seems to think he&#39;s more of a piece of shit than Un&#39;yo is. Another hypothesis is that Mamagane is said sister-in-law.</p><figure><img src="https://qwerty9149.s-ul.eu/DEJomxlL"><figcaption>Fig. 5  Given her fetish of being stared at, it doesn&#39;t seem implausible that Kaguya would want Miyuki to call her a &quot;bad girl&quot; (211.1 p.12)</figcaption></figure><p>This isn&#39;t to show that either of these theories must necessarily be true (yet another hypothesis posits that Mamagane is in fact a Hayasaka given her hair colour), but that there are enough Chekhov&#39;s guns buried in both the Shinomiya and Shijo families that slotting Mamagane in somewhere isn&#39;t a long stretch by any means.</p><p>***</p><p>Some possible supporting evidence:</p><p>Throughout the series, Papagane has always been the voice of reason: though fond of trolling his kids, when it comes to serious matters he takes on the role of author stand-in, giving lengthy monologues about how Akasaka sees things such as the romance between our main characters. So it seems suspicious that Papagane would refuse to sign the divorce papers for a woman who&#39;s left him for seven years since it&#39;s arguably not in character with what we hear from him about romance in other chapters (&quot;That&#39;s the true nature of romance. Eternal love doesn&#39;t exist&quot;, 160 8).</p><figure><img src="https://qwerty9149.s-ul.eu/Enh4Qa28"><figcaption>Fig. 6  Kinda sus ngl (83 p.15)</figcaption></figure><p>Since Kei came back after a while, she would know where Mamagane was during that period; it&#39;s not much of a stretch that Papagane would be told where she is after Kei came back. &quot;Mamagane is with the Shinomiyas/Shijos now&quot; would be a good reason to not sign the divorce papers because this gives him a much more practical reason to do so instead of &quot;I still love her&quot;.</p><p>***</p><p>In conclusion: We&#39;re not certain where she currently is, but what we do know is that it&#39;s almost certain she&#39;s still connected to the Shinomiya and/or the Shijo family, and we&#39;ve not seen the last of her. Expect her to pop back up later.</p><p><a href="/">Back</a></p></article>
