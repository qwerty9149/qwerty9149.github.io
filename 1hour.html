The sun was still low in the sky, and the form next to her casted long and thin shadows across the room. Speaking of which...</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Mmrh... &#39;cuz it&#39;s... hard to... wake up...&quot; the boy next to her muttered as he rolled over slightly, yanking the sheets over his head.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;You&#39;re—&quot; she started, before she abruptly stopped, since she&#39;d noticed something she&#39;d somehow failed to notice before.</p><p><br></p><p>She didn&#39;t have anything on.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;...Oh,&quot; she whispered to herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Memories of what had happened yesterday swept like a torrential downpour back into her mind. He&#39;d invited her over under the pretense of playing a retro shooting game that had an offline multiplayer mode while his parents were out on a trip. They had been talking about their seniors in the student council, she remembered, and somehow — whether it be due to their penchant for not mincing words and topics with each other, or simply due to the tension you get from being awake so late into the night with a person you like and you know likes you — the topic had somehow turned to their seniors&#39; love lives, with nary a limiter in sight. </p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Ugh, I really didn&#39;t need to hear about how she wanted to take a bath with him. That&#39;s, like, way too much information,&quot; he&#39;d ranted.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;I guess it&#39;s nice of them, though,&quot; she&#39;d responded quietly, her eyes focused on the TV screen where she was mowing down enemies like they were but mere plants to be watered.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Yeah, I guess I&#39;m happy to know that they have a healthy relationship, especially knowing how scary she was back then. You know how scary she was, right? I could&#39;ve sworn she was gonna kill me at some point... I would have laughed myself to death if you told me that she&#39;d be taking a bath with the President in less than a couple of years.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Hmm,&quot; she muttered. &quot;That&#39;s true. Speaking of which, I guess I&#39;ve never considered how convenient it is to take a another person with you into the bath. My arms aren&#39;t that long, so washing my back is usually really tough for me, you know. I guess having another person wash your back for you is a lot better than doing it yourself.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p>The boy tried, and failed, to stop himself from envisioning her taking a shower and trying to reach for her back. He could feel blood start to flow towards places he really didn&#39;t want blood to flow towards right now; as if in response, the character on his screen started to move slightly erratically, jerking left and right in irregular ways.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Speaking of which, I haven&#39;t taken a shower yet today...&quot; she&#39;d continued.</p><p><br></p><p>He failed to come up with a suitable response in time. He could feel the tension rise in the room, as if he&#39;d missed an important prompt on a galgame. Sweat started to form on his brow.</p><p><br></p><p>An awkward silence.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;...Do you mind if I go take a shower after we finish this round?&quot;</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Want me to join you?&quot; he&#39;d responded, without thinking about what he was saying at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The implications of what he&#39;d said only sank in between them after a couple of seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>He waved his arms around frantically. &quot;I mean, uh, you were talking about how convenient it is to have somebody else with you in the bath, so that was the natural joke to make, you know, uh, um...&quot;</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;...So are we gonna do it or not?&quot; she&#39;d whispered quietly, looking directly into his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Another moment of silence. He met her gaze.</p><p><br></p><p>And he suddenly seized her hand like something had possessed him, and they&#39;d almost ran out of the room together, and they&#39;d, and they&#39;d...</p><p><br></p><p>Something she once said crept unbiddingly back into her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;I can drop the good girl act, right?&quot;</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it had worked, obviously, but at the end of the day she was but a young maiden (well, not anymore, she chuckled to herself), and this was her first time doing any of this. She had absolutely no idea what she was getting herself into, and she was quite obviously totally out of her depth. And it was with *that* idiot, too.</p><p><br></p><p>Luckily, perhaps.</p><p><br></p><p>He was quite gentle.</p><p><br></p><p>But it still stung a bit down there.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;...Never mind that now,&quot; she thought to herself, taking large breaths to calm herself down.</p><p><br></p><p>Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.</p><p><br></p><p>......</p><p><br></p><p>Now that she&#39;d calmed down a bit from processing everything that&#39;d happened, a lurking curiosity that had always been within her suddenly caught up with her, and she decided on a reckless impulse to satisfy it.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;...Hey. You awake?&quot; she muttered beneath her breath, poking at the form of the boy next to her.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no response at all. Evidently, he&#39;d fallen asleep again.</p><p><br></p><p>Satisfied that he wasn&#39;t awake at all, she carefully lifted the sheets on top of him up and peeked under them.</p><p><br></p><p>It looked almost cute, all shriveled up like a fat worm. It was almost impossible to imagine that yesterday night, this was the thing that had...</p><p><br></p><p>She threw the sheets back onto him in another sudden fit of embarrassment.</p><p><br></p><p>That, however, was enough to wake him up.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;...Hmm?&quot; he muttered, as he turned towards her and peeked at her through bleary eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>He took a moment to process what was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Wait, what the fuck am I supposed to do now?&quot; he asked himself. Anime and manga had taught him how to act properly when trying to get a girl into your bed, but never how to get one out of it, he realised. They usually just cut straight to the next day.</p><p><br></p><p>Trying and failing to come up with an idea, he, however, couldn&#39;t help but be distracted by the form of the girl sitting up next to him.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; he muttered, the words flowing out of his mouth so smoothly it surprised even himself.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;...You idiot,&quot; came the reply, and she leaned onto him, as if to reward him for saying the right thing at the right time.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the second alarm rang.</p><p><br></p><p>They both jumped.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="/">Back</a></p></article>
