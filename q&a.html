Q.002 So far, the only StuCo member who hasn&#39;t fallen in love is Fujiwara Chika-chan, but will youth ever come for Chika-chan?
&gt; Fujiwara&#39;s always the most youthful.

Q.003 Have we done the other side of the Cubari Facaccimo before?
&gt; You won&#39;t be able to come back if you go searching for things about the Cubari Faccacimo.

Their relationship seemed to revert back to normal during the school trip.</p><p>&gt; Fujiwara managed to escape. Fujiwara seems to be a little wary of Hayasaka now.</p><p><br></p><p>Q.006 Maki once called herself &quot;a legitimate descendant of the Shinomiya bloodline&quot;, but given the relationship between the Shinomiyas and the Shijos, why does she emphasise her connection to the Shinomiya family?</p><p>&gt; It seems that she sees the current Shinomiya family as being illegitimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Q.007 It seems that the worldviews of Kaguya-sama and Oshi no Ko are connected, but chronologically speaking, when does Kaguya-sama take place in relation to Oshi no Ko?</p><p>&gt; Oshi no Ko is chronologically set years after Kaguya-sama. It seems that the members of the StuCo will then be members of society.</p><p><br></p><p>Q.008 It seems that Hayasaka&#39;s birthday has not been officially published, but when is her birthday officially? </p><p>&gt; It seems that her grade in school is a year off from her actual birthday.</p><p><br></p><p>Q.009 I have a question about Kei-chan. I think Kei-chan passed the entrance examination [for Shuchiin] after Prez failed both the kindergarten and primary school entrance examinations, but did she start from kindergarten or from primary school? I would also like to know how she met the Fujiwara sisters.</p><p>&gt; It seems that many who started from kindergarten are considered to be at the top of of Shuchiin. Kei-chan and Ishigami seem to have started from elementary school.</p><p><br></p><p>Q.010 Will Maki-chan ever find happiness?</p><p>&gt; I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be rich.</p><p><br></p><p>Q.011 (In Volume 23, Chapter 222), Fujiwara challenged Ice Kaguya to a game, but who won that game?</p><p>&gt; Kaguya won the game itself, but Fujiwara seems to have won overall. It seems that Kaguya can&#39;t beat Fujiwara very often.</p><p><br></p><p>Q.012 Where do these vignettes that make one laugh and cry come from?</p><p>&gt; From not lying about emotions.</p></article>
